# ifcbUTOPIA Data Pipeline Tools

This repository contains a collection of notebooks to streamline the process of converting raw IFCB data to CNN-labeled and validated datasets.

Set up these notebooks by cloning the repository to your local machine (instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)), creating a new python environment in anaconda or miniconda with the environment file included by typing `conda env create -f environment.yaml`. The environment's name is "ifcb-utopia", so activate it with `conda activate ifcb-utopia`.
